### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the Google Cloud Console
- Admin access to your Google Search Console property

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
### Step 1: Create a New Project in Google Cloud Console

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**: Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on the project dropdown at the top left of the page.
   - Select "New Project".
   - Enter a name for your project and click "Create".

### Step 2: Enable the Required APIs

### Step 3: Create a Service Account

1. **Navigate to the Service Accounts Page**:
   - Go to `IAM & Admin` > `Service Accounts`.
2. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Click `+ Create Service Account`.
   - Enter a name and description for the service account, then click `Create`.
3. **Grant the Service Account Permissions**:
   - In the "Grant this service account access to project" section, add the role `Owner`.
   - Click `Continue`, then `Done`.

### Step 4: Generate and Download the JSON Key

1. **Create Key for Service Account**:
   - Find your service account in the list and click on its email.
   - Go to the `Keys` tab.
   - Click `Add Key` > `Create New Key`.
   - Select `JSON` and click `Create`. This will download a JSON file containing your credentials. Store this file securely as `gserv.json` in your web project root directory so Hawk JS will use it for API authentication.

### Step 5: Add Service Account to Google Search Console

1. **Open Google Search Console**: Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/).
2. **Add the Service Account as an Owner**:
   - Select your property in Google Search Console.
   - Go to `Settings` > `Users and permissions` > `Add user`.
   - Enter the email address of your service account and select the role `Owner`.
   - Click `Add`.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully obtain and configure service account credentials for accessing the Google Indexing API and Google Search Console API.
