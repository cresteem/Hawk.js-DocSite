  <summary>What is G-Index in Hawk.js?</summary>
  <p>
    **G-Index** is a strategy in Hawk.js that utilizes the **Google Indexing API** to notify Google about new or updated content on your website. This strategy is particularly useful for ensuring that time-sensitive or frequently updated pages, such as job postings, livestream events, and breaking news, are indexed quickly by Google. By using G-Index, Hawk.js allows faster indexing and better search visibility for such content.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>When should I use G-Index with Hawk.js?</summary>

    Once you have completed the steps to obtain your **Google service account credentials**, store the downloaded JSON key file (`gserv.json`) securely in your web project's root directory. This file will be used by Hawk.js for authenticating API requests to both the **Google Indexing API** and **Google Search Console API**.
    
    For detailed assistance, refer to the [Google Cloud Console Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs) and [Google Search Console Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/).

  <summary>What are the key considerations when setting up FTP credentials for Hawk.js?</summary>
  <p>
    When configuring FTP credentials for Hawk.js, keep these important considerations in mind:
    - **FTP Root Directory:** The FTP root directory must align with the web server's root directory (e.g., `public_html` or `/var/www/html`).
    - **No Directory Navigation:** Hawk.js does not navigate between directories on your FTP server. It only uploads files directly to the home (primary) directory of the FTP connection.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the steps to set up an FTP server for Hawk.js?</summary>
  <p>
    Here are the steps to set up an FTP server and integrate it with Hawk.js:

    <strong>Step 1: Check FTP Support on Your Hosting Plan</strong>
    - Ensure that your hosting plan includes FTP support by reviewing your plan's features or contacting your hosting provider.

    <strong>Step 2: Set Up an FTP Account</strong>
    - Use your hosting provider’s control panel (e.g., **cPanel**, **HPanel** for Hostinger, or a custom dashboard) to create an FTP account.

    <strong>Step 3: Configure FTP Credentials</strong>
    - When setting up your FTP account, define these credentials:
      - **Hostname:** The domain name or IP address of the FTP server (e.g., `ftp.example.com` or `192.168.1.1`).
      - **Username:** The username for your FTP account.
      - **Password:** The password for your FTP account.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I integrate FTP credentials into Hawk.js?</summary>
  <p>
    To integrate FTP credentials into Hawk.js, update your `hawk.config.js` file with the necessary FTP details:

    ```js
    /** @type {import("@cresteem/hawk-js").hawkJsOptions} */
    const config = {
        ftpCredential: {
            username: "your-ftp-username",
            password: "your-ftp-password",
            hostname: "ftp.example.com",
        },
    };
    exports.default = config;
    ```

    This will ensure that Hawk.js can use the FTP credentials for uploading files such as sitemaps and authorization files.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are some best practices for FTP configuration?</summary>
  <p>
    Follow these best practices when configuring FTP for Hawk.js:
    1. **Match FTP and Web Server Roots:** Ensure the **FTP root directory** matches the **web server's root directory** (e.g., `/public_html`).
    2. **Secure Your Credentials:** Store your FTP credentials securely and restrict access to the `hawk.config.js` file to prevent unauthorized access.
    3. **Verify File Uploads:** After setting up Hawk.js and running a strategy that requires FTP (e.g., **IndexNow**), verify that the files are correctly uploaded to the FTP server's root directory.
