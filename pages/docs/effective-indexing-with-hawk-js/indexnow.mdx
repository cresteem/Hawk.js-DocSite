# IndexNow with Hawk.js

**[IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/)** is a revolutionary protocol that allows webmasters to notify search engines instantly when new or updated content is available on their website. This ensures minimal delay between content updates and its availability on search engines like **Bing**, **Yahoo**, **Yandex**, **Sheznam.cz**, **Naver**, **Yep** and also **DuckDuckGO**. Hawk.js integrates seamlessly with **IndexNow**, offering an easy way to automate the process of notifying search engines about your content updates.

## How IndexNow Works

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1. **Triggering Hawk.js with IndexNow Strategy:**
   When you trigger Hawk.js with the **IndexNow** strategy (or any other strategy), Hawk.js records the **timestamp** of the last run. This allows Hawk.js to track any changes made to the files since the last execution.

#### 2. **Tracking File Updates:**
   Each time Hawk.js runs, it checks the modification timestamps of your website’s files. If the timestamp of a file is newer than the last recorded trigger timestamp, it marks that file as **updated**. These files are added to the list of updates that Hawk.js will notify search engines about.

#### 3. **Handling Authentication:**
   If you are triggering for the first time, Hawk.js will generate a **unique hash key** for your website's domain. This hash key is essential for **authentication** with the **IndexNow API** and is used to validate the source of the request.

#### 4. **FTP Server Configuration:**
   In order to use **IndexNow**, you must have an **FTP server** set up. Hawk.js will store the generated **hash key** on this server, making it accessible to the **IndexNow API**. The API will check if the hash key exists on your FTP (Web) server to authenticate the request.
   
   Make sure your FTP server is configured correctly to store the **hash key** file. Without this configuration, Hawk.js will not be able to communicate with the **IndexNow API**.

#### 5. **IndexNow API Request:**
   After the **hash key** is stored on your FTP server, Hawk.js proceeds by sending a request to the **IndexNow API**. This request includes the updated list of files that have been modified or added since the last trigger.

#### 6. **Authentication and Crawling:**
   The **IndexNow API** checks whether the **hash key** is present and authenticated on your FTP server. If the key is valid, the API allows the **IndexNow** process to continue, and the relevant search engines (Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Yep) will begin to crawl the updated files.

#### 7. **Search Engine Indexing:**
   Once authenticated, the **IndexNow API** sends the request to the supported search engines to crawl and index the updated or newly added pages on your website. This ensures that your content is quickly indexed and available in search results, minimizing the delay associated with traditional crawling methods.

## How to Use IndexNow with Hawk.js via CLI

### Prerequisites:

Before you start using **IndexNow**, ensure that you have:

- A **working FTP server** where Hawk.js can store the hash key file.
- The **correct configuration** set up in your `hawk.config.js` to include the necessary FTP credentials and paths.

### Steps:

1. **Configure Your FTP Server:**
   Set up an **FTP server** and ensure that it can store the **hash key** generated by Hawk.js. This is necessary for authentication with the **IndexNow API**.

2. **Run Hawk.js with IndexNow Strategy:**
   To trigger Hawk.js with the **IndexNow** strategy, use the following command:

   ```bash
   hawk --strategy 1
   ```

   This will start the process of checking your website for updates and notifying the IndexNow API about the changes.

3. **Monitoring and Updates:**
   Hawk.js will keep track of the files on your website, ensuring that only updated or newly added files are sent to the **IndexNow API**. Every time you run the command, Hawk.js compares file timestamps to determine if there have been changes.

4. **Verify Successful Indexing:**
   Once the **IndexNow API** has processed the request and crawled the updated pages, your content will be indexed by the supported search engines, allowing your website to rank higher and remain up-to-date in search results.

## Key Considerations:

- **FTP Credentials:** Make sure your FTP credentials are correctly configured in the `hawk.config.js` file for proper communication with your FTP server.
  
- **Authorization:** When you trigger for the first time, Hawk.js will generate a unique **hash key** and store it on your server. Ensure your FTP server is properly set up to handle this.

- **Search Engine Support:** Verify that the search engines you want to target support the **IndexNow** protocol, as not all search engines may support it at the moment.

By using **IndexNow** with Hawk.js, you can significantly speed up the process of getting your website’s content indexed by major search engines, ensuring better visibility and faster updates in search results.
