# GitHub Actions

## Case 1: GitHub Actions Workflow for `IndexNow` Strategy

### Prerequisite

#### GitHub Secrets Setup:
To create secrets in GitHub, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets` > `New repository secret`.
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `FTP_HOST`
   - `FTP_USERNAME`
   - `FTP_PASSWORD`

#### Hawk.js Configuration Example (`hawk.config.js`):
Ensure that the configuration is properly set to reference the secrets and FTP details. Example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Your basic config here
  ftpCredential: {
    hostname: process.env.FTP_HOST,
    username: process.env.FTP_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.FTP_PASSWORD,
  },
};
```

### Workflow

This workflow will:
- Set up Node.js.
- Install Hawk.js.
- Run the Hawk.js CLI with the **IndexNow** strategy to notify search engines about updates to your website content.

#### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/indexnow.yml`

```yaml
name: Hawk.js IndexNow Strategy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on push to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests targeting the main branch

jobs:
  indexnow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'  # Choose your desired Node.js version

      # Step 3: Install Hawk.js
      - name: Install Hawk.js
        run: |
          npm install @cresteem/hawk-js -g

      # Step 4: Set up FTP credentials in environment variables (GitHub secrets)
      - name: Set up FTP credentials
        run: |
          echo "FTP_HOST=${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "FTP_USERNAME=${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "FTP_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      # Step 5: Run Hawk.js with IndexNow strategy
      - name: Run Hawk.js with IndexNow strategy
        run: |
          npx hawk --strategy 1  # Trigger the IndexNow strategy

      # Step 6: Optionally, generate the sitemap
      - name: Generate the sitemap
        run: |
            npx hawk genmap
```

### Breakdown of the Workflow:

1. **Trigger on `push` and `pull_request`:** This workflow will be triggered whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is made targeting the `main` branch.

2. **Checkout Repository:** The workflow checks out the repository so that it can access your files.

3. **Set up Node.js:** The workflow sets up a specific version of Node.js (e.g., version 16).

4. **Install Hawk.js:** It installs `@cresteem/hawk-js` from npm registry.

5. **Set up FTP Credentials:** It retrieves FTP credentials from GitHub secrets and sets them as environment variables. These credentials are used by Hawk.js for uploading the sitemap or hash key if necessary.

6. **Run Hawk.js with IndexNow Strategy:** It runs Hawk.js using the `--strategy 1` flag, which tells it to use the **IndexNow strategy**.

7. **Generate the sitemap** Optionally.

### Notes:
- **IndexNow strategy (`--strategy 1`)** sends notifications to supported search engines (Bing, Yandex, etc.) when updates are made to your content.
- The `npx hawk --strategy 1` command triggers the indexing process.

## Case 4: GitHub Actions Workflow for Generating Sitemap

This section will provide a GitHub Actions workflow for generating a sitemap using Hawk.js. Additionally, the workflow will allow for optional FTP upload of the generated sitemap.

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/generate-sitemap.yml`

```yaml
name: Generate Sitemap with Hawk.js

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on push to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests targeting the main branch

jobs:
  generate-sitemap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'  # Set your desired Node.js version

      # Step 3: Install Hawk.js
      - name: Install Hawk.js
        run: |
          npm install @cresteem/hawk-js -g  # Install Hawk.js globally

      # Step 4: Generate the sitemap (without upload)
      - name: Generate Sitemap (No Upload)
        run: |
          npx hawk genmap -i "src/**/*.html" -e "node_modules/**"  # Generate sitemap without uploading

      # Step 5: Optionally, generate and upload the sitemap to FTP server
      # Uncomment the next step to enable uploading the sitemap after generation
      - name: Generate and Upload Sitemap
        run: |
          npx hawk genmap -i "src/**/*.html" -c  # Generate sitemap and upload to FTP server
```

---

### Breakdown of the Workflow:

1. **Checkout Repository:**  
   The workflow starts by checking out your repository to allow access to your files, including the configuration file `hawk.config.js`.

2. **Set Up Node.js:**  
   This step sets up a specific version of Node.js (`v20` in this case) required for Hawk.js to run.

3. **Install Hawk.js:**  
   Hawk.js is installed globally using `npm install @cresteem/hawk-js -g`. This is necessary to run the `hawk` CLI command.

4. **Generate Sitemap (No Upload):**  
   This step generates the sitemap based on your project's `.html` files, excluding the `node_modules` directory. The command is:

   ```bash
   npx hawk genmap -i "src/**/*.html" -e "node_modules/**"
   ```

   This will generate a sitemap without uploading it anywhere. The `-i` flag specifies which files to include, and the `-e` flag excludes the specified pattern (`node_modules/**`).

5. **Generate and Upload Sitemap (Optional):**  
   This step generates the sitemap and uploads it to your FTP server. If you wish to upload the sitemap, simply enable this step by uncommenting it. The command is:

   ```bash
   npx hawk genmap -i "src/**/*.html" -c
   ```

   The `-c` flag instructs Hawk.js to upload the generated sitemap to the FTP server specified in your `hawk.config.js`. This step will only run if you enable it by uncommenting.

---

### Notes:

- **Generate Sitemap Without Upload:**  
   The workflow will generate the sitemap and store it in your repository without uploading it. This is useful if you want to review the generated sitemap locally or handle uploading in a separate process.

- **Generate and Upload Sitemap to FTP:**  
   The optional step allows you to upload the sitemap directly to an FTP server after generation. Make sure that you have configured the FTP credentials in your `hawk.config.js` file, and that the FTP server is accessible.

- **FTP Credentials:**  
   If you're uploading to an FTP server, ensure that your FTP credentials are properly set in the `hawk.config.js` and are securely stored in GitHub Secrets (e.g., `FTP_USERNAME`, `FTP_PASSWORD`, `FTP_HOST`).

Got it! Here's a revised **final note** focusing solely on the strategies and sitemap generation process with **GitHub Actions**, making it clear that this is the conclusion for this specific section:

---

## Final Notes

You've now successfully set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate your sitemap generation and submission process with Hawk.js. This workflow covers the following strategies:

- **IndexNow Strategy:** Automatically notify search engines like Bing and Yandex about updates to your website.
- **Google Webmaster Strategy (GWebMaster & GWebMaster2):** Submit your sitemap and receive detailed feedback on indexing and crawl status.
- **G-Index Strategy:** Use Google’s Search Indexing API to notify Google about updates for quicker indexing.
- **Sitemap Generation:** Generate a sitemap and optionally upload it to an FTP server for search engines to crawl.

By leveraging **GitHub Actions**, your website’s content will stay fresh in search results, ensuring better visibility and faster updates.

### Next Steps:
- If you're using other Continuous Integration platforms like **[GitLab CI](/docs/ci-cd-with-hawkjs/gitlab-ci)** or **[Jenkins](/docs/ci-cd-with-hawkjs/jenkins)**, explore the specific workflow setups for those environments in the next sections of the documentation. These platforms follow similar steps, with slight variations in syntax and setup.

Happy automating with Hawk.js!
