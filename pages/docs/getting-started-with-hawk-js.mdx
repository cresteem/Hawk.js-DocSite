  ### Initiate the Configuration File
  
  Use the following command to create a default configuration file:
  ```bash

  This will generate a `hawk.config.js` file in your project directory.
  

  ### Customize Your Configuration
    - Open the newly created `hawk.config.js` file. 
    - Define the patterns you wish to include and exclude.
    - Customize additional settings as per your requirements.

  ### Credentials

For certain indexing strategies, you'll need to provide specific credentials. 

- **For `G-Webmaster`, `G-Webmaster2`, and `G-Index` strategies**, you will need your **Google Webmaster Tools credentials**.
- **For the `IndexNow` strategy**, FTP credentials are sufficient for the submission process.

Be sure to input these credentials in the configuration file as per the requirements for the strategy you are using.

- `1` for `Index-Now` 
- `2` for `G-Webmaster`
- `3` for `G-Webmaster2`
- `4` for `G-Index`
  
Along with optional parameters like `--include`, `--exclude`, and `--prettify`.
