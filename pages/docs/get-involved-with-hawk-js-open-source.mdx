## Contribution Guidelines

Here’s how you can start contributing to Hawk.js:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the [Hawk.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/cresteem/Hawk.js).
   - Click the **Fork** button to create a personal copy of the repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Hawk.js.git
     cd Hawk.js
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Use descriptive names for your branches, such as `feature/add-logging` or `bugfix/fix-typo`:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Implement your feature, fix bugs, or improve documentation. Ensure you adhere to the project’s coding standards.

5. **Set Up a Local FTP Server (for Testing):**
   - Hawk.js requires an FTP server for testing certain functionalities like sitemap uploads. You can quickly set up an FTP server using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 21:21 -p 21000-21010:21000-21010 \
       -e USERS="user:password:1001" \
       -e ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 \
       delfer/alpine-ftp-server
     ```
   - This command creates an FTP server with a user named `user` and a password `password`. Replace them with your preferred credentials if needed.

6. **Test Your Changes:**
   - Run tests locally to verify your changes don’t break any existing functionality:
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```
   - Ensure the FTP server is running during testing for features that require it.

7. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     ```

8. **Push to Your Fork:**
   - Push your branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

9. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Go to the original [Hawk.js repository](https://github.com/cresteem/Hawk.js) and open a pull request (PR).
   - Provide a clear description of the changes in your PR, including screenshots or logs if applicable.
